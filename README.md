### Ecommerce Django - Django REST Backend
[Link](https://github.com/Zunku/ecommece-django)

A production-oriented e-commerce backend built with Django REST Framework.
It exposes a secure and scalable API for managing products, collections, carts, and orders, with role-based permissions and robust validation. The system integrates PostgreSQL for data integrity, Redis for caching, Celery for background tasks, and JWT for stateless authentication. Performance and reliability were validated using automated tests with pytest and load testing with Locust, ensuring the API behaves correctly under real-world conditions.
